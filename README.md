# RecommendationSystemForMovies--A-priori-reservoir-sampling
We continue in this work the film evaluation system using the A-priori algorithm and with random selection  sampling with the reservoir sampling algorithm. We study the search for rules of correlation between the different films of format: "IF SOMEONE RATED HIGH THE A's films THEN they would probably want to see B's films as well." In order to do this, you will be dealing with measuring the frequency of occurrence (i.e., of support in the form of a percentage and not an absolute number of impressions) sets of items in baskets. Specifically, consider the viewers as baskets (each viewer is a different userId), the contents which consist of those movies (each movie is a different movieId) that were voted by the specific spectator with a rating of at least MinScore, for a MinScore value {{1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5} provided by the user as input. You will use the APRIORI algorithm that you will implement, initially in the entire collection of baskets and then in a random constant length sample from the collection you will create (taking the collection as basket flow) to calculate sets of movies that (probably) have a frequency of AT LEAST MinFrequency. Then, given the (potentially) common sets of objects discovered in collection of baskets, you will create for each of them all the correlation rules that satisfy some criteria of importance (minimum confidence - escalation) that
